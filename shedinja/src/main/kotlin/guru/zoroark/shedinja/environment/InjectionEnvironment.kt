/**
 * An injection environment is, in a nutshell, a container for injectable components. These injectable components can be
 * retrieved in two ways:
 *
 * - Via the [get] function, which retrieves the component identified according to the given parameter
 * - Via the [createInjector] function, which returns an [Injector] that is able to retrieve injectable elements using a
 * Kotlin property delegator.
 *
 * ### Guarantees (or lack thereof)
 *
 * Internally, injection environments can use whatever mechanism they want. No guarantees are given on the mutability or
 * stability of the returned components -- it is up to the implementation of the injection environment to provide such
 * guarantees.
 *
 * All implementations should clearly state their characteristics in their documentation:
 *
 * - **Lazy** or **eager object creation**
 * - **Lazy**, **eager** or **active object injection**.
 * - **Idempotent/Immutable**, **NI/Immutable** or **NI/Mutable** (NI = non-idempotent).
 *
 * Here are the templates that should be used:
 *
 * - **Object creation**
 *      - **Eager object creation**. Objects are created upon construction of this environment.
 *      - **Lazy object creation**. Objects are created upon first use.
 * - **Object injection**
 *      - **Eager object injection**. Objects are injected upon calling the injection method.
 *      - **Lazy object injection**. Objects are injected upon first use, and are only computed once.
 *      - **Active object injection**. Objects are re-injected at every use.
 * - **Mutability**
 *      - **Idempotent/Immutable**. Objects cannot be replaced, injection methods will always return the same thing.
 *      - **NI/Immutable**. Objects cannot be replaced, injection methods will not always return the same thing.
 *      - **NI/Mutable**. Objects can be replaced, injection methods will not always return the same thing.
 *
 * ### Companion object
 *
 * The bridge between the DSL and environments is made via a [InjectionEnvironmentKind] object. This object can be
 * passed to the [guru.zoroark.shedinja.dsl.shedinja] function to determine the environment that should be built.
 *
 * Implementors should have a companion object that implements [InjectionEnvironmentKind], allowing for easy usage
 * within the DSL. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * class MyInjectionEnvironment : InjectionEnvironment {
 *     companion object : InjectionEnvironmentKind {
 *         fun build(context: EnvironmentContext): MyInjectionEnvironment {
 *             // ...
 *         }
 *     }
 *     // ...
 * }
 *
 * shedinja(MyInjectionEnvironment) {
 *     // ...
 * }
 * ```
